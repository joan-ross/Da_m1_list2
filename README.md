# Additional Basic List Exercises

Welcome to the additional basic list exercises assignment! This exercise will help you further practice working with lists in Python by implementing a few more functions. Follow the instructions below to complete the assignment.

## Instructions

1. **Fill in the Code:**
   - You will complete the functions provided in the `list2.py` file.
   - Each function has a description of what it should do. Your task is to write the code inside each function to achieve the described behavior.
   - The `main()` function is already set up to call these functions with various inputs and print `'OK'` when a function is correct.

2. **Function Descriptions:**
   - **Remove_adjacent:**
     - Given a list of numbers, return a list where all adjacent equal elements have been reduced to a single element.
     - Example: `remove_adjacent([1, 2, 2, 3])` should return `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - **Linear_merge:**
     - Given two lists sorted in increasing order, create and return a merged list of all the elements in sorted order.
     - Ideally, the solution should work in "linear" time, making a single pass of both lists.
     - Example: `linear_merge(['aa', 'xx', 'zz'], ['bb', 'cc'])` should return `['aa', 'bb', 'cc', 'xx', 'zz']`.

3. **Testing Your Code:**
   - The `main()` function includes test cases that will help you verify if your implementations are correct.
   - The `test()` function compares the output of your function with the expected result and prints `'OK'` if they match, otherwise it prints `'X'`.

## Submission

- Complete as many functions as you can.
- Ensure your code runs without errors.
- Submit your completed `list2.py` file by pushing your repo to GitHub and it will auto grade. 

Happy coding!
